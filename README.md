It exists as part of Spring Boot web:

- Spring web MVC;

We will talk here of make a Spring REST API, but in the process we will talk about some parts like Spring Rest Controllers.

Teacher presented us `Glory of REST`, with some levels:

The starter of Spring REST API comes with a Tomcat listening on the port `8080`.
